# result-tracker

This is a tracker I put together to help with the local Ski Racing team. Goal was to keep things simple, and get a solution in place that would allow their parents to see times, standings, and race orders in real time.

It is built with React. I did not add Redux, but considered it many times. In trying to keep it simple I have not added it. I also considered context-api, but again I just don't think the complexity it adds is worth the benefit yet.
